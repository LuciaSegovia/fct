# Introduction

Contains information on the food matching for Malawi household surveys, including IHS4 and IHS5.

# IHS 4
**Change log**
V.2.0 - updated on  2023-05-31: Fixed items with not matches on any of the FCTs used in MAPS tool. 

#Important

Thobwa: 24230.03.03 - maize- and millet-fermented beverage, change description in dictionary & found a match for millet-fermented beverage on WA19.
  
Maize ufa madeya (bran flour): 39120.04.01 - maize bran, flour, raw --> No information, changing to whole grain flour (23120.03.01)
  
Gathered wild green leaves: 1214.06 - blackjack leaves, raw - recoded (1290.9.16)
  
Squash (Sobo drink concentrate):  24490.01 - sugar sweetned beverage, concentrate (New code)

Sun Dried fish (Small Variety):  1505.03 -  barb, silver, dried, raw (New code)
  
Fresh fish (Small Variety):  1501.06 -  barb, silver, fresh, raw - recode (1501.11)
  
Groundnut fresh (unshelled): 142.03 - peanuts, fresh, unshelled, raw. No information on fresh peanuts, hence we need to adjust the quantity from fresh consumption to dry E.g., 100g of fresh weight will be 100*(100-50)/(100-10), and matched to dry peanuts. This is important to not over-estimate the nutrient content from the food consumption.
  
Freezes (flavoured ice):  23670.01.02 - flavoured ice - recoded ("22270.06")
  
Smoked fish (Small Variety):  1505.06 -  barb, silver, smoked, raw (New code)

Sun Dried fish (Large Variety): 1505.02 - tilapia, dried, raw (New code)
  
Smoked fish (Large Variety):  1505.05 - tilapia, smoked, raw (New code)
  
Smoked fish (Medium Variety):  1505.05 -  tilapia, smoked, raw (New code)

Hot sauce (Nali, etc.): 1699.06 - tabasco, sauce - recode (F1232.04)
  
Termites, other insects (eg Ngumbi, caterpillar): 21170.92.02 - edible insect adults, fresh, raw - recode (21183.02) (termite dry as in MW19).
  
Cassava - roasted (vendor): 1520.01.03 - cassava root, roasted - recode (1520.01.05) Roasted was not available

## IHS5-foodid matching to Genus

There are some items that should be removed:

 1) [106] There are two codes for identical item = rice. We amended genus to account for imported and local rice production hence, differentiate between the two. Unless, it is specified, we will sort for local when possible. 
 2) [510] It is a redundant code, as mice is actually rabbit meat. We should remove and use only rabbit until we found mice. 
 3) [816] Remove sweets, chocolate with milk because acc. to Gareth inputs that's hardly found in Malawi. We identified an issue that with the other code that should be solved at FCT level 
 4) [832] Remove orange-sweet potato. It also has an issue that it should be fixed at FCT level.
 5) [836] A typo in food genus that was solved in version 2.5 samosa and banana cake sharing the same id, was the cause of this error. Now it's solved. Hence it doesn't need to be removed any more. 
 
IHS5 - genus matches were sent to Gareth Osman to double-check that the assumptions made were consistent with Malawi reality. 

Below are the comments to be solved:

 1) 118 - 'MAIZE UFA RAW MADEYA (bran flour - unprocessed), code 118, is missing. --> Fixed
 2) 412 - Tinned vegetables (specify) change to Tinned beans. = Tinned, beans (MW02_0003) --> Fixed
 3) 106 - rice was duplicated --> Fixed. 
 4) 829 - restaurant meals ---> Nsima (MW01_0031 - F1232.05) - check min values for this recipe, chicken (MW03_0010 - F1061.01), rape leaves, boiled (MW04_0020*Retention factor), change to amaranth leaves, boiled (MW04_0010 - ) --> Fixed but w/o retention factors
 5) 816 - Change compo to candies
 6) 708 - Add infant formula data
 
-Recalculate min values for all sweet potato using Edward:

-Provisional fix to create OFSP version

 6) 832 and 831 - Add b) version w/ orange: copy and paste values and 
 7) 204 - OFSP
 8) 203 - WFSP
 
Changed value of VITA_RAE of (831) white boiled sweet potato to match raw white sweet potato adjusted w/ retention factor. We did not do a water adjustement because the water content difference in water was <10%, hence according to FAO/ INFOODS Guidelines there is no need to water adjust 
[2.213000*(100-76.00/100-77.28)]
 
Make a note to fix all recipes in MAFOODS.

- Check ref for small fish:

 9)  5023        Sun Dried fish (Small Variety)     
 10) 5033        Fresh fish (Small Variety)  
 11) 5123        Smoked fish (Small Variety) 

- Check infant feeding formula
